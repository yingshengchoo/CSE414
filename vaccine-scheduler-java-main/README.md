# vaccine-scheduler-java

Creating a simulation for scheduling a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, incorporating the three primary vaccines (J&J, Pfizer, Moderna), with the option for caregivers to add new ones. The primary goal of this project is to improve my understanding of database applications, which involves utilizing SQL in JAVA, designing ER diagrams, implementing data normalization, and executing SQL queries/updates. In this project, I worked mainly on the following files:

src.main.resources
- design.pdf: the design of your database schema.
- create.sql: the create statement for your tables.

src.main.scheduler.model
- Caregiver.java: the data model for your caregivers.
- Patient.java: the data model for your users.
- Vaccine.java: the data model for vaccines.

src.main.scheduler
- Scheduler.java: the main runner for your command-line interface.
