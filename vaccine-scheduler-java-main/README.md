# vaccine-scheduler-java

This is my final project for CSE414: Introduction To Database Systems.

I had the opportunity to delve into the world of vaccine scheduling. The project centered around creating a simulation for COVID-19 vaccine appointment scheduling, featuring the three primary vaccines (J&J, Pfizer, Moderna), and even allowed caregivers to seamlessly add new ones. While a substantial portion of the code was provided, the project was a valuable exprience for me. Throughout the project, I honed my understanding of database applications, navigating the intricate relationship between SQL and Java. Designing ER diagrams, implementing data normalization, and executing SQL queries/updates became second nature. What's more, I got hands-on experience working with Azure Cloud, broadening my horizons in the process. I can't claim credit for starting from scratch, but the project underscored my ability to comprehend and work with complex code. For this project, I specifically worked on the following files:

src.main.resources
- design.pdf: the design of your database schema.
- create.sql: the create statement for your tables.

src.main.scheduler.model
- Caregiver.java: the data model for your caregivers.
- Patient.java: the data model for your users.
- Vaccine.java: the data model for vaccines.

src.main.scheduler
- Scheduler.java: the main runner for your command-line interface.
